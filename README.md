# Foods of Tomorrow - Android Recipe Application

## Description
The primary function of the app is to help users discover recipes based on their preferences. Users can filter a pre-defined list of recipes by selecting a protein type (Beef, Chicken, Pork, or Fish) and then by a budget category ($10, $15, $20). The application demonstrates key Android development concepts like MVC and SOLID design principles.

Some specific implementations are as follows:
-   Activity and Layout management.
-   UI components like `RecyclerView`, `CardView`, and `Button`.
-   Passing data between Activities using `Intent`.
-   Data persistence through File I/O for a "Favorites" feature.
-   Loading and parsing data from a local `recipes.csv` file using the OpenCSV library.

## Code Style
By adhering to Model, View, Controller(MVC) and SOLID design principles as well as combining with an Object Oriented Programming(OOP) language like Java, I was able to separte out logic clearly and maintain singular functionality between methods.
